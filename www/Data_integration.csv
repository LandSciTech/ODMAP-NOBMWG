Methods,Description,Comments
Simple pooling,"""..different data sources are combined to model species distribution without explicit acknowledgement of the data sources in the modeling process."" (Fletcher et al. 2019).",Add your comments/explain here
Combining independent models,"""..the focus is on developing independent models for each data source and then combining them in some ways."" (Fletcher et al. 2019).",Add your comments/explain here
Incorporating informed priors,""".. one source of data is used to provide a prior distribution for one or more parameters when modeling the second data source. Using informed priors requires that the model for the first set of data (used to obtain the prior) has the same parameters as the model for the second source of data..""

Integrated distribution models,"Two approaches: ""..First, models have integrated coarse grain data, such as atlas data, with fine-grain data to downscale predictions of models (Keil et al. 2014). Second, models have been developed to link data of differing quality of information and amount, with a focus on linking presence-only data with other data sources to address known limitations of this data type (Dorazio 2014, Fithian et al. 2015)."" (Fletcher et al. 2019).",Add your comments/explain here
Using auxiliary data,"""..The use of auxiliary data has been commonly applied in two ways. First, some models have included one species as a covariate to explain the distribution of another species (Araujo and Luoto 2007, Trainor and Schmitz 2014). Second, some modeling approaches have included secondary data to inform modeling the species of interest (e.g,. range maps; Merow et al. 2017).""
