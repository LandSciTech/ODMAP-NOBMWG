Algorithm settings,"""Algorithm settings, or hyperparameters, are parameters that control how the training process itself is carried out. They are not learned from data but are set by the model designer before training. In a neural network, hyperparameters include the learning rate, the number of epochs, the batch size, and the activation function. Algorithm settings influence the speed, accuracy, and stability of the training process. They can impact whether the model converges, overfits, or underfits the data. Algorithm settings provide control over the model's learning process and help optimize performance. "" (Goolge 2025)."

Neurons are organized into three different layers: input, hidden and output. The input layer has one neuron for each predictor variable in the model and the output layer has a neuron for each response variable. Neurons in the hidden layer allow for interaction effects between predictor variables and the analyst can choose the number of interactions in the network by increasing the number of neurons in this layer as well as adding additional hidden layers"" (Nieto et al. 2017)."

This process addresses issues like missing values, outliers, incorrect data entry, and duplicated records, which can significantly affect the model's accuracy and reliability."" (Google 2025)."
Data partitioning,"It refers to dividing a dataset into subsets before building and evaluating the model. for instance, Partitioning data into training and testing sets to evaluate how well the model performs on unseen data.

""Error propagation is the calculation of statistical error in a quantity that comprises multiple components each with associated error. Such quantities constitute the end point of many ecological studies, but composite errors are rarely incorporated so that uncertainty in the final estimate is either unknown or underestimated."" (Blukacz et al, 2005)."
Evaluators,"Evaluators come from multiple disciplines and expertises and provide actionable feedback to models' inputs, outputs and metadata. For instance, evaluators can be taxonomic (e.g., birds) and survey experts that possess a deep knowledge and understanding of the ecology, biology and the geographic/environmental context of the species. Their knowledge allows them to review part of and/or the entire model, providing feedback to modelers. Evaluators can also review specific parts of the model. For instance, statisticians can review how modelers treated data sets (e.g., aggregating observations) and also assess the appropriateness of statistical analysis and the rigor in meeting statistical assumptions. Other modelers, unrelated to the model’s design, can play a significant role in providing feedback on specific aspects of the models (e.g., alternative algorithms, model tuning, etc.). Resource managers can evaluate information needs for multiple applications (e.g., forest management, habitat conservation, co-benefits) when confronting model outputs. They also can assess the risk of implementing a specific scenario due to a certain level of uncertainty."

GAMs (Generalized Additive Models),"""GAMs (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986, Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) are semi-parametric extensions of GLMs; the only underlying assumption made is that the functions are additive and that the components are smooth. A GAM, like a GLM, uses a link function to establish a relationship between the mean of the response variable and a ‘smoothed’ function of the explanatory variable(s). The strength of GAMs is their ability to deal with highly non-linear and non-monotonic relationships between the response and the set of explanatory variables. GAMs are sometimes referred to as data- rather than model-driven. This is because the data determine the nature of the relationship between the response and the set of explanatory variables rather than assuming some form of parametric relationship (Yee and Mitchell, 1991). Like GLMs, the ability of this tool to handle non-linear data structures can aid in the development of ecological models that better represent the underlying data, and hence increase our understanding of ecological systems."" (Guisan et al. 2002)."
Geo-referencing errors,"""Georeferencing errors occur when a map or image is not accurately aligned with real-world coordinates. Common sources of error include inaccurate control points, incorrect coordinate entry, misinterpretations of scales/units, and using inappropriate transformation methods. Other issues can arise from distortions in the original data, such as drafting errors or distortions during printing or digitization"" (Google 2025)."
GLMs (Generalized linear models),"""GLMs are mathematical extensions of linear models that do not force data into unnatural scales, and thereby allow for non-linearity and non-constant variance structures in the data (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990). They are based on an assumed relationship (called a link function; see below) between the mean of the response variable and the linear combination of the explanatory variables. Data may be assumed to be from several families of probability distributions, including the normal, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, or gamma distribution, many of which better fit the non-normal error structures of most ecological data. Thus, GLMs are more flexible and better suited for analyzing ecological relationships, which can be poorly represented by classical Gaussian distributions (see Austin, 1987)."" (Guisan et al. 2002)"

Species-covariates correlations,Variables included in the models do in fact reflect the niche requirements of a species
Specificity,"""The proportion of observed presences that were correctly predicted to be present by the SDM."" (Lee-Yaw et al. 2021)."
State variables,
Target output (Model utility and applicability),"Identifying the utility, applicability and objective(s) of implementing a model will help multiple users and partners to understand why models are developed for (e.g., Guillera et al. 2015). "
Temporal extent,"It describes the period of time an event, (e.g., specific year (e.g., 2002) or a range (2005-2020)"
Temporal resolution,"It refers to the frequency with which data or measurements are collected over time (e.g., every week during the breeding season June-Sep). "
Threshold,"""In Species Distribution Models (SDMs), thresholds are used to convert continuous predictions (e.g., probabilities of presence) into binary predictions (e.g., presence/absence). These thresholds determine the minimum probability required for a location to be classified as a suitable habitat. Different threshold selection methods can impact the predicted range size and changes therein."" (Google 2025, see also Scherrer et al. 2018). For occurrence site see Shim et al. (2023)."
TNR (True negative rate),"""Also known as Specificity, measures the proportion of actual negatives (absence of the taxon) that are correctly identified"" (Lazagabaster et al. 2024)."
TPR (True positive rate),"""Also known as Sensitivity or Recall, measures the proportion of actual positives (presence of the taxon) that are correctly identified by the model""  (Lazagabaster et al. 2024)."
Transferability,"""Transferability in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) refers to the ability of a model built in one area (e.g., for a species' native range) to accurately predict the species' distribution in a different area or under different conditions"" (Google 2025, see also (Werkowska et al. 2016, Rousseau & Betts 2022, Charney et al. 2021)"
transformation,
TSS (True skill statistic),"""Quantifies the model's ability to avoid both false positives and false negatives"" (Lazagabaster et al. 2024). TPR+ TNR-1"
Uncertainty,"""Uncertainty in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) refers to the inherent variability and imprecision in the predicted distribution of a species due to various factors influencing the modeling process, data, and assumptions."" (Goolge 2025). For instance, (1) unceratinty in model inputs such a covariates data sets (e.g., climate variables Fernandez et al. 2013), and uncertainty in species datasets that arises from several factors, including data completeness, taxonomic quality, temporal decay, spatial and environmental distance, and the inherent variability in ecological processes (e.g., Naimi et al. 2013, Fernandes et al. 2019, Gabor et al. 2023). (2) uncertainty in model predictions, that is the inherent variability or lack of perfect knowledge in the predictions made by a model, (e.g., Baele & Lennon 2012). (3) uncertainty in model bulding (4) uncertainty in statistical anlaysis, parametrization, selection and evlaution (e.g., Gould et al. 2014)."
upscaling,
URL (Uniform Resource Locator),"""A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string of characters that identifies the location of a specific resource on the internet, such as a webpage, file, or image"" (Google 2025)."
Validation data,"In Species Distribution Models (SDMs), validation data is a portion of the data set that is not used to train the model but is instead used to evaluate its predictive accuracy and performance"" (Google 2025)."
Model reliability,"""In the context of species distribution models (SDMs), ""model reliability"" refers to the accuracy and consistency of the model's predictions, particularly in terms of its ability to accurately represent the observed distribution of a species and its capacity to generalize to new data or situations. It essentially measures how well the model's predictions align with the real-world distribution of the species."" (Google 2025, see also Bryn et al. 2021)."
Model plausibility,"""In Species Distribution Models (SDMs), model plausibility refers to the degree to which a model's predictions align with ecological understanding and observed patterns. It's a crucial aspect of model evaluation, ensuring that the model's results make sense within the context of the species and its environment. A plausible model not only accurately predicts species occurrences but also reflects biologically realistic relationships between species and their environment."" (Google 2025)"
