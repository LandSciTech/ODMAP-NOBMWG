Their knowledge allows them to review part of and/or the entire model, providing feedback to modelers. Evaluators can also review specific parts of the model. For instance, statisticians can review how modelers treated data sets (e.g., aggregating observations) and also assess the appropriateness of statistical analysis and the rigor in meeting statistical assumptions. Other modelers, unrelated to the model’s design, can play a significant role in providing feedback on specific aspects of the models (e.g., alternative algorithms, model tuning, etc.).

"gam","GAMs (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986, Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990) are semi-parametric extensions of GLMs; the only underlying assumption made is that the functions are additive and that the components are smooth. A GAM, like a GLM, uses a link function to establish a relationship between the mean of the response variable and a ‘smoothed’ function of the explanatory variable(s). The strength of GAMs is their ability to deal with highly non-linear and non-monotonic relationships between the response and the set of explanatory variables. GAMs are sometimes referred to as data- rather than model-driven. This is because the data determine the nature of the relationship between the response and the set of explanatory variables rather than assuming some form of parametric relationship (Yee and Mitchell, 1991). Like GLMs, the ability of this tool to handle non-linear data structures can aid in the development of ecological models that better represent the underlying data, and hence increase our understanding of ecological systems.",""
"Generalized linear models (glm)","""GLMs are mathematical extensions of linear models that do not force data into unnatural scales, and thereby allow for non-linearity and non-constant variance structures in the data (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990). They are based on an assumed relationship (called a link function; see below) between the mean of the response variable and the linear combination of the explanatory variables. Data may be assumed to be from several families of probability distributions, including the normal, binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, or gamma distribution, many of which better fit the non-normal error structures of most ecological data. Thus, GLMs are more flexible and better suited for analyzing ecological relationships, which can be poorly represented by classical Gaussian distributions (see Austin, 1987).""
