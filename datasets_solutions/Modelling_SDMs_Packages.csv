R,biomod2,,"Ensemble Platform for Species Distribution Modeling. Functions for species distribution modeling, calibration and evaluation, ensemble of models, ensemble forecasting and visualization. The package permits to run consistently up to 10 single models on a presence/absences (resp presences/pseudo-absences) dataset and to combine them in ensemble models and ensemble projections.",https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/biomod2/
R,dismo,,"Methods for species distribution modeling, that is, predicting the environmental similarity of any site to that of the locations of known occurrences of a species.",https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dismo/
R,ecospat,,"Collection of R functions and data sets for the support of spatial ecology analyses with a focus on pre, core and post modelling analyses of species distribution, niche quantification and community assembly. ",https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ecospat
R,ENMeval,,"Runs ecological niche models over all combinations of user-defined settings (i.e., tuning), performs cross validation to evaluate models, and returns data tables to aid in selection of optimal model settings that balance goodness-of-fit and model complexity. Also has functions to partition data spatially (or not) for cross validation, to plot multiple visualizations of results, to run null models to estimate significance and effect sizes of performance metrics, and to calculate range overlap between model predictions, among others.

R,sdm,,"An extensible framework for developing species distribution models using individual and community-based approaches, generate ensembles of models, evaluate the models, and predict species potential distributions in space and time.",https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdm
R,SSDM,,"Stacked Species Distribution Modelling. Allows to map species richness and endemism based on stacked species distribution models (SSDM). Individuals SDMs can be created using a single or multiple algorithms (ensemble SDMs). For each species, an SDM can yield a habitat suitability map, a binary map, a between-algorithm variance map, and can assess variable importance, algorithm accuracy, and between- algorithm correlation. Methods to stack individual SDMs include summing individual probabilities and thresholding then summing. Thresholding can be based on a specific evaluation metric or by drawing repeatedly from a Bernoulli distribution.

R,wallace,,"A Modular Platform for Reproducible Modeling of Species Niches and Distributions. The 'shiny' application Wallace is a modular platform for reproducible modeling of species niches and distributions. Wallace guides users through a complete analysis, from the acquisition of species occurrence and environmental data to visualizing model predictions on an interactive map, thus bundling complex workflows into a single, streamlined interface",https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wallace
R,R-INLA,,"The integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) is a method for approximate Bayesian inference. In the last years it has established itself as an alternative to other methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo because of its speed and ease of use via the R-INLA package. Although the INLA methodology focuses on models that can be expressed as latent Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF), this encompasses a large family of models that are used in practice.",https://www.r-inla.org/
