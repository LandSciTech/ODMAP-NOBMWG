General,Equilibrium,"SDMs often assume that species are in equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium) with their environment in their native range. That is, suitable habitat is fully occupied or saturated (e.g., Gallien et al. 2012, Zurell et al. 2024).","Native range is restricted by biotic interactions (e.g., competition, predation, disturbances, etc.) (Richmond et al. 2010). There is increasing evidence that range-shifting species are lagging behind their climatically suitable habitat (Svenning et al. 2008), leading to suitable habitat not yet colonised (“colonisation credit”) ....

General,Niche stability,"SDMs typically assume that species maintain their ecological niche (the set of environmental conditions they require to thrive) across space and time. That is, ""Ecological niche models also assume niche conservatism"" (Wiens et al. 2009, Gallien et al. 2012).","New ecological relationships in introduce range.

General,Niche truncation,"The model must capture the entire ecological niche to be appropriately projected to other spatiotemporal contexts., ... can occur when the geographic extent used to fit the model does not include all possible conditions that compose the ecological niche of a species (Guisan et al. 2025).","When this is not the case, there is a risk that the modelled response curves of the species along environmental gradients are truncated, resulting in biased and often incorrect predictions of species distributions (Chevalier et al. 2021)  (Guisan et al. 2025)",It can lead to biased projections of species distributions under climate change (Guisan et al. 2025),"Implement Nested SDMs (N-SDMs; Guisan et al. 2025)., Calibrate models over the whole species range; then focus on regions (e.g.; Scherrer et al.  2021)., Acknowledge modelers were unable to address this assumption",

Therefore, some statistics may be inaccurate or even wrong (Crase et al.2014)."" (Guisan et al. 2017). ""Residual spatial autocorrelation can be caused by various factors or processes not accounted for in the modelling, which may include extrinsic processes, such as unknown habitat characteristics (Legendre 1993), intrinsic processes, such as conspecific interactions (Wintle and Bardos 2006), or a combination of the two. (Mielke et al. 2020).",TBD,TBD,TBD,
Species datasets,Unbiased species data,"Unbiased species data refers to a non-random distribution of presence data.

(e.g., Hernandez et al. 2006).  sample size has the most profound effect on the performance of an SDM (Thibaud et al. 2014, Santini et al. 2021).

(Soley et al. 2024).","There is a potential situation where two or more predictor variables in a statistical model are linearly related. However, Removing predictor variables a priori without consideration of their information content may arbitrarily discard informative data (reducing the predictive ability of the model) and does not directly address the problem of overfitting (Breiman 2001, Olden et al. 2008, Braunisch et al. 2013) (Soley et al. 2024).","It inflates the variance of regression parameters (Dormann et al. 2012)., It might potentially leads to the wrong identification of relevant predictors in a statistical model (Dormann et al. 2012)., Models trained with correlated variables are prone to error when the correlation between variables changes in model transfer scenarios.

Although it is essentially impossible to guarantee zero errors in mapped environmental predictors, estimates of spatial distribution of errors could be associated with each layer and used to calculate spatial uncertainty in the model predictions (Barry and Elith 2006; Van Niel and Austin 2007). There is still a need for a proper method for combining errors from the different environmental variables in the model.

Metodological choices,Appropriateness of the statistical methods,"Different types of response variables require different types of statistical models (Guisan and Zimmermannn2000). For instance, semi-quantitative data require very specific modeling techniques, such as ordinal regressions (Guisan and Harrell2000). Quantitative data are easier to model and there are numerous techniques available for doing so (see Part III) but, different types of quantitative responses will still require different types of statistical models. Counts of species or of individuals usually require specifying Poisson, negative binomial, or other probability distribution functions (PDF) for discrete positive values, a requirement that can be met using several modeling techniques, such as generalized regressions (e.g. Vincent and Haworth1983) or boosted regression trees (e.g. Thuiller et al.2006; see Part III). Binary response variables, such as species’ presence–absence data, require binomial PDF and logistic transformation (e.g. the link function in GLMs and generalized additive models (GAM); see Part III) and represent by far the data for which the largest range of modeling techniques is available in ready-to-use packages. Techniques for binary response variables are also the main ones presented in this book. Once a statistical method has been chosen, it is assumed to be the right one for the data in hand.
