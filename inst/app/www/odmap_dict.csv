Predicitons: BAM models were produced for the purpose of modelling the distribution and abundance of ~143 breeding land birds in the boreal forest across Canada, for years 1991 to 2018, at spatial resolution ~ 1Km2. Separate models were constructed for each of 16 separate spatial subunits consisting of bird conservation regions (BCRs) intersected with Canadian jurisdictional boundaries.  In total, we sampled data from 296,061 point counts across Canada (across a total of 256,316 site locations and 175 distinct projects). We used 219 spatially explicit environmental covariates. We implemented boosted regression tree (BRT) models (32 BRT outputs per species and subregions).; 2) Testing hypotheses: Anderson et al. (2099)  tested hypotheses about the mechanisms driving species range shifts under climate change or Peterson et al (2018) tested how different methodological choices in SDM construction (e.g., choice of algorithm, predictor variables, background extent) influence the robustness and transferability of climate change projections, and thus the resulting predictions about species persistence or shifts. 3) Forecasting: Feeley & Silman (2018) used  SDMs to project future distributions while incorporating crucial ecological processes often overlooked in simpler models, such as dispersal limitations and more nuanced species responses to environmental change. Backsting: Maiorano et al. (2020) used SDMs for backcasting species distributions into the past (e.g., LGM), seeking to reconcile these model-based reconstructions with independent palaeo-ecological records (like fossil pollen or macrofossil data).",,0,1,1,1,,,,,1,0
